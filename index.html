     <h3>Open Sans & Montserrat</h3><br>
        <p><b>Open Sans</b> is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets.</p><p>The old posters and signs in the traditional <b>Montserrat</b> neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique.</p>

     <h3>Roboto Slab & Smooch Sans</h3><br>
        <p><b>Roboto</b> has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves.</p>
        <p><b>Smooch Sans</b> was originally designed as a truncated font to be used to compliment the Smooch brush script file. It has been updated with an extensive character set and designed as a Variable font to a offer nine weight variations of this clean sans font.</p>

         <h3>Poppins & Raleway</h3><br>
     <p>Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the worldâ€™s stage. <b>Poppins</b> is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.</p>
         <p><b>Raleway</b> is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic was added in 2016.</P>
